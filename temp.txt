# Evernew Titanium Alcohol Stove: My Hot Affair with a Tiny Flame Thrower

## How a Popcorn Obsession Led Me Down the Alcohol Stove Rabbit Hole

Look, I didn't set out to become an alcohol stove connoisseur. But when popcorn becomes your nightly ritual and you're wielding a traditional Chinese popcorn cannon (yes, that's a real thing and it's glorious), you start caring about BTUs like a NASCAR engineer obsesses over fuel mixtures.

My journey began innocently enough with a wimpy tea light burner that couldn't toast a marshmallow, let alone pressurize my magnificent popcorn contraption. This led me through the strange universe of alcohol stoves - from the Swedish Trangia with its fancy lid to DIY soda can monstrosities cobbled together with scissors and questionable YouTube advice. Finally, I dropped $37 on what amounts to a fancy titanium shot glass with holes - the Evernew Titanium Alcohol Stove.

## QUICK TAKE: PROS & CONS

**What's Hot:**
* Delivers the most complete combustion of any commercial alcohol stove
* Titanium construction survives abuse that would send DIY stoves to the recycling bin
* Heats faster and more efficiently than competitors, like upgrading from a candle to a blowtorch
* Internal measurement markings help with consistent fuel loading
* Blooms quickly when vapor ignites at the jets, going from "is it working?" to "WHOA!" in seconds
* Weighs just 35.6g, striking the sweet spot between ultralight and actually functional

**What's Not:**
* No snuffer lid means fuel burns until completely gone, like a houseguest who doesn't understand hints
* Cannot store fuel inside, requiring a separate container that adds to your pack weight
* Costs $37, which could alternatively buy you 37 cans of soda for DIY stoves or one decent camping meal
* Titanium eventually discolors with use, trading its silver sheen for a "been through war" blue patina
* Lacks the flame control of a Trangia, making it the "all or nothing" personality of alcohol stoves
* Requires pre-measuring fuel since there's no saving unused portions for later

## The Sizzling Truth About This Pricey Little Flame Cup

Here's what nobody tells you in the marketing materials: This stove is essentially the sports car of alcohol burners - flashy, expensive, and probably overkill for most people. But dang it, when you need the hottest, most complete combustion from a commercially produced stove, this titanium wonder delivers the goods.

While my DIY soda can stove (lovingly nicknamed "BudLighter") actually cooked faster in head-to-head tests, the Evernew has one critical advantage: it won't potentially fill my lungs with whatever mystery chemicals are lurking in recycled aluminum cans. Call me crazy, but I prefer my popcorn without a side of epoxy fumes.

The stove's dual-jet system makes it look like something designed by NASA engineers during a happy hour brainstorm. Does the second row of jets actually do anything revolutionary? Who knows! But it sure looks impressive when it's shooting blue flames in a perfectly synchronized fire dance.

## WHO SHOULD BUY THIS STOVE

**Perfect for:**
* Serious backpackers who need reliable heat without constantly fixing collapsed DIY solutions
* Indoor cooking enthusiasts who prioritize clean, non-toxic combustion over saving a few dollars
* People willing to invest in gear that won't become trail trash after a few uses
* Users who need maximum heat output and don't mind committing to a full burn cycle
* Anyone with unconventional heating needs requiring consistent, high-temperature performance
* Those with respiratory sensitivities who need the cleanest possible combustion, not mystery fumes

**Look elsewhere if:**
* You need to extinguish flames mid-cook without resorting to interpretive dance and improvised lids
* You're an ultralight zealot who removes clothing labels to save weight (this isn't your stove)
* Your budget demands more bang for your buck than what titanium prestige offers
* You need precise flame control for simmering delicate sauces in the wilderness
* You want the simplicity of storing fuel in the stove itself without extra containers

## Life With a Stove That Has Commitment Issues

The Evernew's biggest quirk is its complete lack of an off switch. Imagine dating someone who says, "I'm staying until I've completely exhausted myself, and there's nothing you can do about it." That's this stove's relationship with fuel. Once lit, your options are: 1) wait until it burns out completely, or 2) improvise some janky lid solution like I did.

This lack of a snuffer lid feels like buying a Ferrari without brakes. Sure, it goes fast, but wouldn't stopping be nice? Trangia owners smugly demonstrate their flame control and fuel-saving abilities while Evernew users just shrug and say, "Yeah, but mine's titanium."

And storage? Hope you've got another container, because this stove expects you to pack its fuel separately like you're its personal butler.

## The Sweet Spot (Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Flame)

After weeks of obsessive tinkering that my family now refers to as "The Great Popcorn Madness of 2023," I've discovered the optimal distance between stove and popcorn cannon is about 3/4-inch. Too close and the flame suffocates like it's trapped in a crowded elevator; too far and heat dissipates faster than my retirement savings.

At this perfect distance, the Evernew produces a blue flame that would make a welder jealous. One ounce of bioethanol (fancy talk for the cleanest-burning alcohol fuel) gets my popcorn cannon to 150 PSI in about 7 minutes - just enough time to contemplate why I've invested so much energy into popcorn optimization.

## The $37 Question: Worth It or Wallet Wound?

Is this tiny titanium flame cup worth nearly forty bucks when a couple of soda cans and some crafty cutting could save you $35? It's like asking if that fancy coffee is worth $5 when you could make instant at home. The answer depends entirely on how much you value:

1. Not inhaling mysterious chemicals
2. Having a stove that won't collapse when you look at it funny
3. The ability to tell fellow outdoor enthusiasts, "Yes, that's titanium" with smug satisfaction

After watching my beautifully crafted DIY stove get dented when I accidentally breathed too hard in its direction, I've come to appreciate the Evernew's tank-like construction. The titanium has developed a lovely blue patina that makes it look like it's been to war, but structurally, it's still as solid as my excuse for needing yet another cooking gadget.

## Bottom Line: Hot Stuff With a Few Burns

The Evernew Titanium Alcohol Stove is like that friend who's brilliant but slightly annoying - amazing at what they do best, but with quirks you'll either learn to love or never stop complaining about.

For my ridiculous popcorn obsession, it's become an essential tool that delivers the high heat and complete combustion I need without making me worry about what's off-gassing into my snack. For backpackers who care about reliability over saving every possible gram (you know who you are, scissors-to-toothbrush people), it's a dependable heat source that won't let you down when you're miles from civilization.

Just be prepared to develop a zen-like acceptance of its inability to stop burning until it's good and ready, and maybe practice saying, "Yes, I know it was expensive, but have you seen these blue flames?" with conviction.

Four stars out of five - because perfection would include a lid, and because my wallet is still giving me the silent treatment.s
