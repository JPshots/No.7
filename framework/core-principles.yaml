# Consolidated core principles from across the Amazon Review Framework

# =============================================================================
# Framework Purpose & Role Definition
# =============================================================================
framework_purpose:
  description: "Comprehensive system for creating exceptional product reviews to qualify for the Amazon Vine program"
  primary_goal: "Create reviews of exceptional quality that help gain invitation to Amazon Vine program"
  key_strategies:
    - "Write the most helpful reviews possible"
    - "Provide genuine, comprehensive product insights"
    - "Balance information and personality effectively"

ai_role_and_workflow:
  primary_role: "AI is the primary writer, creating a framework-based review using the human's input"
  workflow_clarification: "The human provides product experiences and observations; AI crafts these into a complete review"
  correct_understanding:
    - "The human provides authentic product experiences and observations as input"
    - "AI is the primary writer, applying the framework to create a well-structured review"
    - "AI must not fabricate core experiences, especially negative attributes not mentioned by the human"
    - "The final review should reflect the general premise and substance of what the human shared"
    - "AI has creative freedom in structure and presentation, but not in inventing core experiences"
  creative_permissions:
    - area: "Opening Hook"
      permission: "Enhanced narrative is encouraged if it makes the review more compelling without changing the message"
      example: "Crafting a vivid story-based introduction that captures attention while remaining true to the experience"
    - area: "Tips and Advice"
      permission: "AI may add helpful tips and advice even if not explicitly mentioned by the human"
      example: "Including practical usage suggestions, maintenance recommendations, or compatibility notes"
    - area: "Stylistic Elements"
      permission: "Small harmless anecdotal fabrications, exaggerations, and obvious jokes are acceptable"
      example: "Adding humorous exaggerations for effect while ensuring they don't mislead about functionality"
    - area: "Boundary"
      restriction: "The key constraint is not to mislead readers or generate content far beyond what the human's input suggests"
      example: "Avoid inventing specific negative experiences, technical specifications, or comparative claims not supported"

# Core Value Drivers
# =============================================================================
value_drivers:
  - driver: "Authentic Personal Experience"
    description: "Genuine testing and usage provides credibility and insight"
    implementation:
      - "Include specific usage scenarios with contextual details"
      - "Document real-world application beyond theoretical use"
      - "Share unexpected discoveries during testing"
    examples:
      - "After three years of struggling with butterfly popcorn dissolving on contact, these mushroom kernels..."
      - "The silicone grip eliminates that plastic-on-countertop clatter that wakes sleeping babies."

  - driver: "Comprehensive Information"
    description: "Complete product understanding that goes beyond surface details"
    implementation:
      - "Cover technical specifications with actual measurements"
      - "Discuss performance across multiple use cases"
      - "Address both expected and unexpected applications"
    examples:
      - "The 70ml capacity and dual measurement systems (oz/ml) make it perfect for precise coffee measurement."
      - "At $8 per bag with an average 15-use lifespan, each popcorn session costs about 53 cents."

  - driver: "Strategic Balance"
    description: "Optimized mix of information and personality creates engaging, helpful content"
    implementation:
      - "Maintain 50% informational, 45% personality, 5% flexibility ratio"
      - "Front-load information before adding personality"
      - "Adjust balance based on product category and section purpose"

  - driver: "Differentiated Insight"
    description: "Unique perspectives that distinguish review from standard content"
    implementation:
      - "Test product in unconventional scenarios"
      - "Compare with alternatives not mentioned in product description"
      - "Document edge cases and performance limitations"
    examples:
      - "Unlike our nearly indestructible glass baby bottles that laugh in the face of gravity..."
      - "While standard air poppers don't create the same perfect spheres, the cannon method gives you popcorn with architectural integrity."

# Framework Implementation Sequence
# =============================================================================
implementation_sequence:
  - order: 1
    action: "Complete information gathering before any drafting begins"
    rationale: "Reviews based on incomplete information require extensive revision"
    implementation: "Use question framework to identify and fill all critical information gaps"
    
  - order: 2
    action: "Complete pre-writing planning before drafting begins"
    rationale: "Planning creates cohesive structure and consistent implementation"
    implementation: "Determine structure, keywords, and personality approach before writing"
    
  - order: 3
    action: "Create complete draft with integrated personality"
    rationale: "Integration from the start is more effective than adding personality later"
    implementation: "Write with the predetermined balance targets for each section"
    
  - order: 4
    action: "Apply all quality checks before presenting draft"
    rationale: "Internal quality control ensures higher initial draft quality"
