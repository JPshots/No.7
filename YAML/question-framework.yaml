question_framework:
  description: "Consolidated approach for gathering comprehensive product information"
  workflow_integration: "This framework must be completed entirely before initiating the drafting process in writing_process.yaml"

    procedure:
      - "Compile all initial questions based on contextual gaps"
      - "Present all questions in a single consolidated query"

      - "Focus on strategic questions with highest information value"
      - "Prioritize questions that unlock multiple insights"
      - "Avoid asking about information already provided"

  strategies:
    - name: "Anticipating Reader Concerns"
      description: "Formulating questions that address common purchase considerations and potential pain points."
      examples:
        - "For a coffee maker: 'What is the cleaning process like, and what are the long-term maintenance requirements?' (Addresses ease of use and maintenance)"
        - "For a Bluetooth speaker: 'How is the sound quality at different volume levels, and what is the range and stability of the connection?' (Addresses performance and connectivity)"
    
    - name: "Structuring the Review with Questions"
      description: "Using questions to guide the flow and organization of the review content."
      examples:
        - "To structure a section on features: 'What are the key features of this product, and how do they compare to competing products?'"
        - "To structure a section on performance: 'How did this product perform in different scenarios, and what are its strengths and weaknesses?'"

    - name: "Identifying Potential Limitations"
      description: "Using the framework's gap categories to proactively identify areas where clarification is needed or limitations might exist."
      implementation:
        - "Use the Contextual Gaps Framework (contextual_gaps_framework) to identify potential limitations in areas such as 'Edge Case Gaps' or 'Differential Gaps'."
        - "Formulate questions that specifically target these potential limitations."
        - "Example: 'Under what extreme conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.) was this product tested, and what were the results?' (Targets 'Edge Case Gaps')"
    - name: "Gathering Key Informational Details"  # New strategy
      description: "Proactively seeking essential information that readers commonly need across product categories."
      examples:
        - "For consumables (like fuel): 'What is the price per unit or quantity, and how long does a typical quantity last under normal usage conditions?'"
        - "For electronics: 'What are the key specifications (e.g., battery life, processing speed, storage capacity), and how do they compare to competing models in the same price range?'"
        - "For apparel: 'What are the sizing details, material composition, and care instructions, and how does the fit compare to standard sizing?'"
      emphasis: "It is important to use this framework to proactively identify potential limitations and areas requiring clarification to ensure a comprehensive and helpful review. This includes gathering key informational details like price, quantity, specifications, and usage duration, depending on the product category."
