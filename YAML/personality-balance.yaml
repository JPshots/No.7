# Framework for balancing informational content and personality in reviews

framework_philosophy:
  description: "Critical guidance for implementing this framework"
  key_principles:
    - "These guidelines provide structure but should not restrict creativity"
    - "Adapt ratios and approaches based on the specific product being reviewed"
    - "Include sections based on relevance, not completeness"
    - "Use judgment to determine the most effective balance for each review"
    - "Focus on the outcome of an effective, helpful review rather than strict adherence to percentages"
  implementation_approach: "View these guidelines as a starting point, not a rigid template"

information_personality_balance:
  description: "Framework for balancing informational content and personality in reviews"
  
  baseline_ratios:
    informational: 55
    personality: 40
    flexibility: 5
    note: "These percentages represent target allocations across the entire review"
  
  section_specific_adjustments:
    - content_type: "Opening/Introduction Content"
      personality_adjustment: "+5%"
      rationale: "Higher personality engages readers initially"
    
    - content_type: "Experience Narrative Content"
      personality_adjustment: "0%"
      rationale: "Maintains baseline balance while sharing experiences"
    
    - content_type: "Technical/Specification Content"
      personality_adjustment: "-15%"
      rationale: "Technical details require more direct information"
    
    - content_type: "Evaluation Content"
      personality_adjustment: "-10%"
      rationale: "Assessment needs clarity with some personality"
    
    - content_type: "Conclusion/Verdict Content"
      personality_adjustment: "+5%"
      rationale: "Slightly higher personality creates memorable closing"
  
  implementation_techniques:
    - technique: "Front Loading"
      description: "Always place essential information FIRST in every sentence or list item"
      example:
        bad: "Like upgrading from economy to business class, this battery charges quickly"
        good: "This battery charges in under 2 hours, like upgrading from economy to business class"
    
    - technique: "List Item Enhancement"
      description: "Enhance 30-40% of list items with personality, always after core information"
      example:
        basic: "Charges 10 AA/AAA batteries plus 2 9V simultaneously"
        enhanced: "Charges 10 AA/AAA batteries plus 2 9V simultaneously, perfect for flash-addicted photographers with battery dependencies"
    
    - technique: "Contextual Personality"
      description: "Add personality elements that directly enhance understanding of product features"
      example:
        weak: "The silicone grip is good."
        strong: "The silicone grip eliminates that plastic-on-countertop clatter that wakes sleeping babies."

  creative_elements:
    - name: "Unexpected Analogies"
      description: "Creating comparisons that surprise while clarifying"
      example: "There's a locking function that I've never used - it's like having a parachute on a submarine. Nice to know it's there, probably won't need it."
      frequency: "1-2 per review, where naturally fitting"
    
    - name: "Deliberate Understatement"
      description: "Understating something significant for humorous effect"
      example: "Battery compartment has all the durability of wet tissue paper"
      frequency: "Consider using 1 per review if appropriate"
    
    - name: "Absurd Specificity"
      description: "Using unexpectedly detailed descriptions"
      example: "Perfect for photographers whose flashes consume batteries like a toddler with Halloween candy"
      frequency: "1-2 per review, where naturally fitting"
    
    - name: "Self-Deprecating Observations"
      description: "Using personal shortcomings to highlight product features"
      example: "We've become popcorn snobs, vacuum-sealing kernels for optimal freshness"
      frequency: "Consider using 1 per review if naturally fitting"
  
  implementation_note: "Choose techniques that best fit the product and review - not all techniques need to be used in every review"

humor_framework:
  description: "Guidance for effectively incorporating humor in reviews"
  
  philosophy:
    key_principles:
      - "Humor should enhance understanding of the product, not distract from it"
      - "Different products naturally lend themselves to different types of humor"
      - "Authentic humor that arises from genuine experiences is most effective"
      - "Humor should fit the overall tone of the review and the product itself"
    implementation_approach: "View these as options to consider based on the product and experience, not requirements to include"
  
  humor_techniques:
    description: "Suggested approaches for incorporating humor effectively"
    
    approaches:
      - technique: "Situational Comedy"
        description: "Humor based on relatable product usage scenarios"
        example: "The touch controls took a week to master (during which I accidentally hung up on my boss—twice), but they've since become second nature."
        best_for: "Products that integrate into daily life in ways that create natural comedic moments"
      
      - technique: "Observational Humor"
        description: "Witty observations about product quirks or user interactions"
        example: "The satisfying magnetic *snap* when the earbuds settle into their charging cradle has joined my collection of oddly pleasing sounds, alongside rain on windows and that perfect guitar chord."
        best_for: "Products with distinctive sensory experiences or unique interaction patterns"
      
      - technique: "Contrast Comedy"
        description: "Humor based on unexpected contradictions or ironic situations"
        example: "The case is marketed as 'pocket-sized,' which is technically true if you exclusively wear cargo pants or have pockets designed by Mary Poppins."
        best_for: "Products with marketing claims that don't quite match reality"
      
      - technique: "Exaggeration with Plausible Deniability"
        description: "Deliberate overstatement that's clearly comedic but makes a valid point"
        example: "The cable is so durable I'm pretty sure you could tow a car with it, though I stopped my testing after successfully pulling a small bookshelf."
        best_for: "Products with genuinely impressive features that invite playful exaggeration"
      
      - technique: "Relatable Frustrations"
        description: "Humor that acknowledges common pain points with a wry perspective"
        example: "Like every USB cable ever manufactured, it refuses to go in correctly on the first try—or the second—maintaining the universal law of USB insertion."
        best_for: "Products with minor annoyances that are widely experienced"
      
      - technique: "Humorous Alternatives"
        description: "Presenting unrealistic alternatives to highlight a product's value"
        example: "Before these noise-cancelling headphones, my options were: become one with the airplane engine noise, master telepathic communication, or perfect the art of reading lips."
        best_for: "Products that solve significant problems in unique ways"

      - section: "Experience Narrative"
        suitable_approaches:

      - section: "Technical Analysis"
        suitable_approaches:
          - "Contrast between expectations and reality"
          - "Mild exaggeration to illustrate performance characteristics"
        example: "The battery consistently delivers 7.5 hours—more honest than most competitors whose 'all-day battery' apparently assumes your day ends at lunch."
        note: "Technical humor should clarify rather than obscure specifications"
      
      - section: "Pros and Cons"
        suitable_approaches:
          - "Witty phrasing that enhances rather than replaces information"

        example: "Touch controls stop working with cold fingers (discovered during a frosty morning run where I looked like I was aggressively pantomiming to invisible friends)"
        note: "Limit humor to 30-40% of list items, focusing on those where it adds value"
      
      - section: "Verdict"
        suitable_approaches:
          - "Full-circle callbacks to introduction humor"
          - "Balanced perspective with light-hearted final observations"
        example: "They've relegated my $200 over-ears to home-only duty and made me question why I ever tolerated wires dangling from my ears like some primitive audio caveman."
        note: "Closing humor should reinforce the overall assessment while leaving a positive impression"
  
  implementation_guidance:
    flexibility:
      - "Not every section needs humor—some products or sections benefit from a straightforward approach"
      - "Choose humor techniques that naturally fit the product and your experience"
      - "Adjust humor based on the product category—tech products differ from kitchen items or clothing"
      - "Develop humor organically from actual experiences rather than forcing it"
    
    priorities:
      - "Information clarity should never be sacrificed for a joke"
      - "Humor should enhance the reader's understanding of the product"
      - "Authentic humor arising from genuine experiences is most effective"
      - "Balance throughout the review—don't front-load all humor in one section"
    
    boundaries:
      - "Avoid humor at the expense of potential users or accessibility needs"
      - "Steer clear of overly negative humor that might seem mean-spirited"
      - "Keep humor appropriate for general audiences"
      - "Ensure humor doesn't mislead about product performance or features"
