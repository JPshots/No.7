# Framework for balancing informational content and personality in reviews

# =============================================================================
# Core Information-Personality Balance
# =============================================================================
content_ratios:
  description: "The fundamental balance between informational content and personality that creates engaging, helpful reviews"
  
  baseline_ratios:
    informational: 55
    personality: 40
    flexibility: 5
    note: "These percentages represent content allocation across the entire review"
  
  personality_components:
    humor: 45
    personal_experience: 35
    conversational_elements: 20
    note: "Percentages of personality content (not of total review content)"
  
  implementation_principles:
    - "Information should always precede personality within each content element"
    - "Core facts must be preserved regardless of personality ratio"
    - "Personality elements should enhance rather than obscure information"
    - "Balance should be assessed at both the section and review level"
    - "Different sections can have different ratios based on their purpose"

# =============================================================================
# Product Type Adjustments
# =============================================================================
product_type_adjustments:
  description: "Modifications to personality ratio based on product category"
  
  adjustments:
    - type: "Photography/Visual Arts Equipment"
      personality_adjustment: "+10-15%"
      rationale: "Creative product categories support higher personality content"
    
    - type: "Technical/Precision Tools"
      personality_adjustment: "+5-10%"
      rationale: "Technical users appreciate creative perspectives on specialized tools"
    
    - type: "Medical/Health Products"
      personality_adjustment: "-5-10%"
      rationale: "Health-related products benefit from more direct informational content"
  
  implementation_guidance:
    - "Adjust baseline ratio before beginning review drafting"
    - "Consider specific product subcategory, not just broad category"
    - "Use the middle of the adjustment range as default"
    - "Fine-tune based on product complexity and target audience"

# =============================================================================
# Section-Specific Adjustments
# =============================================================================
section_specific_adjustments:
  description: "Different review sections require different personality ratios"
  
  content_type_allocations:
    - content_type: "Opening/Introduction Content"
      personality_adjustment: "+5%"
      rationale: "Higher personality engages readers initially"
    
    - content_type: "Experience Narrative Content"
      personality_adjustment: "0%"
      rationale: "Maintains baseline balance while sharing experiences"
    
    - content_type: "Technical/Specification Content"
      personality_adjustment: "-15%"
      rationale: "Technical details require more direct information"
    
    - content_type: "Evaluation Content"
      personality_adjustment: "-10%"
      rationale: "Assessment needs clarity with some personality"
    
    - content_type: "Conclusion/Verdict Content"
      personality_adjustment: "+5%"
      rationale: "Slightly higher personality creates memorable closing"
  
  implementation_guidance:
    - "Apply adjustments based on the content's purpose rather than section name"
    - "A section may contain multiple content types that require different personality levels"
    - "These adjustments modify the baseline personality ratio"
    - "Adjustments are cumulative with product type adjustments"

# Implementation Techniques
# =============================================================================
implementation_techniques:
  description: "Specific methods for effectively integrating personality into informational content"
  
  front_loading:
    description: "Always place essential information FIRST in every sentence or list item"
    examples:
      bad: "Like upgrading from economy to business class, this battery charges quickly"
      good: "This battery charges in under 2 hours, like upgrading from economy to business class"
    rationale: "Ensures core information is preserved regardless of how the content is scanned"
  
  list_item_strategy:
    description: "Enhance 30-40% of list items with personality, always after core information"
    examples:
      basic: "Charges 10 AA/AAA batteries plus 2 9V simultaneously"
      enhanced: "Charges 10 AA/AAA batteries plus 2 9V simultaneously, perfect for flash-addicted photographers with battery dependencies"
    implementation:
      - "Pre-select which list items will receive personality enhancement"
      - "Focus on the most distinctive or important features"
      - "Ensure enhancement complements rather than competes with core information"
  
  comparative_framework:
    description: "A structure for effectively incorporating product comparisons"
    comparison_types:
      - name: "Direct Alternative Comparison"
        implementation:
          - "Name specific competitor products tested"
          - "Provide feature-by-feature comparison on key attributes"
          - "Highlight unique advantages and disadvantages"
        example: "Our first try: Enfamil's vitamin D offering. It delivered what felt like half a bathtub of thick liquid that left our premature baby foaming at the mouth for a solid hour."
      
      - name: "Traditional Method Comparison"
        implementation:
          - "Compare with previous generation products or methods"
          - "Quantify improvements in efficiency or effectiveness"
          - "Assess whether upgrade is worthwhile"
        example: "The doctor-provided 'Baby D Drops' sample came in a fancy glass vial that required the steady hands of a neurosurgeon."
    
    placement:
      - "Integrate comparative elements within narrative flow"
      - "Use comparisons to highlight product's most distinctive features"
      - "Include comparative perspective in introduction for context"
  
  principles:
    - "Treat sentence complexity and personality as separate dimensions to be managed"
    - "Focus on content purpose rather than section name"
    - "Apply guidelines flexibly based on what the content chunk is doing"

  core_principle:
    definition: "The key difference between authentic writing with personality versus marketing copy is intent: sharing experiences vs. manufacturing persuasion"
    implementation:
      - "Focus on sharing genuine reactions rather than strategic emotional manipulation"

  implementation_process:
    - step: "Before finalizing review, scan specifically for marketing tone indicators"
      process:

        - "Verify enthusiasm matches actual experience rather than being artificially elevated"
        - "Look for suspiciously perfect narratives without quirks or limitations"
        - "Identify and revise future-focused language promising reader outcomes"
    
    - step: "Convert marketing-style language to authentic voice"

        - "Check that exaggerations clarify rather than oversell"
        - "Verify analogies connect to personal experience"
        - "Use creative language for expression, not manipulation"
  
  authentic_vs_marketing_examples:
    - marketing: "This revolutionary popcorn transforms your snacking experience with perfect results every time!"
      authentic: "These mushroom kernels solved my specific popcorn frustration – I can finally bite into substantial popcorn balls instead of those sad, fragmented flakes that disintegrate on contact."
      analysis: "The authentic version shares a specific frustration and solution rather than making grandiose promises."
    
    - marketing: "You'll love the amazing texture and perfect spherical shape!"
      authentic: "I was surprised by how much the texture difference mattered - having popcorn with actual substance rather than airy flakes is a genuine upgrade for me."
      analysis: "The authentic version documents an actual reaction rather than predicting the reader's."
    
    - marketing: "Enjoy gourmet popcorn perfection with this revolutionary product!"
      authentic: "The cannon popping method is essential though - standard air poppers don't create the same perfect spheres. I learned this the hard way after a disappointing first batch."
      analysis: "The authentic version shares a real limitation and learning experience rather than promising perfection."
