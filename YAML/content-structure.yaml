content_organization:

  information_flow:
    - "Structure sections to create logical progression of information"
    - "Begin with engaging personal experience to establish context"
    - "Follow with detailed usage experiences that demonstrate product value"
    - "Include evaluation sections that balance strengths and limitations"
    - "Add audience identification to help readers determine fit"

  formatting_guidance:
    paragraphs: "Brief, scannable (3-5 sentences)"
    lists_enhancement:
      principle: "Add personality to 30-40% of list items"
      implementation: "Always place factual content first, personality second"

      - "Each section should serve a unique informational purpose with minimal overlap"
      - "Information should generally appear in its most optimal section only"
      - "Later mentions of key points should add new dimensions rather than repeating"

      - "Key information may be restated when doing so significantly enhances clarity"
      - "Critical safety or compatibility information may appear in multiple sections when warranted"
      - "Complex technical points may be introduced in technical sections then reframed in simpler terms elsewhere"

      ********** Tales from a Kitchen Lab **********
      The 3oz Glass Measuring Cup Chronicles

      I heard the clink from the next room - that all-too-familiar sound of glass meeting hardwood. Standard glass-breakage scenario initiated: broom deployment, dustpan maneuvers, followed by tactical tweezer operations for rogue foot-shard extraction. Unlike our nearly indestructible glass baby bottles that laugh in the face of gravity, one of our $9 duo chose a more... theatrical exit.

      ---------------

    daily_use: |
      >> THE DAILY EXPERIMENTS
      The surviving cup found its calling under my espresso machine. That pour spout? Actually understands fluid dynamics - directing my precious caffeine without the usual counter splatter. But here's the real discovery: fill one past the final 70ml marking (yes, ALL the way up), and you've got the perfect kernel load for a Chinese popcorn cannon. (Yes, that's a real thing, and yes, it's as awesome as it sounds.)

    evaluation: |
      ** THE SPECS

      -- PROS
      * Perfect size between bulky measuring cups and tiny shot glasses
      * Speaks both metric and imperial (sophisticated!)
      * Pour spout that actually works
      * Ideal for coffee precision and popcorn science

      -- CONS
      - Fragile as my ego after someone criticizes my coffee technique
      - Glass thickness suggests it was designed for a gentler universe
      - Advertised as 3oz, but highest marking is 2.5oz (though there's bonus space above)

    audience_section: |
      >> THE PRECISION SEEKERS
      * Coffee enthusiasts needing precise measurements for pour-overs or espresso shots
      * Recipe developers working with small amounts of ingredients
      * Mixologists crafting cocktails requiring exact measurements
      * Detail-oriented cooks who get frustrated with "eyeballing" small quantities

      >> NOT FOR THE CAREFREE COOK
      - Households with young kids (fragile glass)
      - Anyone cooking primarily large-batch recipes where precision is less critical

    practical_notes: |
      *** FIELD NOTES
      * Keep the box for storage - these aren't drawer-rummaging tools
      * Perfect for pour-over coffee measurements
      * Use with a scale for ultimate kitchen science

      ---------------

    verdict: |
      >> RESEARCH CONCLUSIONS
      At $9 for two, they're solid tools for kitchen precision - just maybe keep one in a protective bunker as backup. Perfect for coffee enthusiasts, careful measurers, and anyone who's muttered "but how much is a 'splash' exactly?" while cooking.
