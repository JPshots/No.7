    description: |
      During the "Pre-Writing Planning" phase of writing_process.yaml, ensure the following keyword-related tasks are completed:
      - Identify primary keywords based on product category and features.
      - Identify secondary keywords related to benefits, usage, and comparisons.
      - Plan keyword placement within the review structure (title, opening, body).
      - Consider keyword variations and long-tail keywords for natural integration.
    reminder: "Refer to the 'Keyword Implementation Check' step in writing_process.yaml > phase_3 for required tasks."
  content_creation:
    description: |
      During the "Content Creation" phase of writing_process.yaml, ensure the following keyword-related tasks are completed:
      - Integrate primary keywords naturally into the title and opening.
      - Weave secondary keywords into the body of the review.
      - Use keyword variations to maintain natural flow and avoid repetition.
      - Include long-tail keywords where appropriate to capture specific user searches.

# Natural Integration Techniques
# =============================================================================
natural_integration_techniques:
  description: "Methods for incorporating keywords naturally without affecting readability"
  
  techniques:
    - name: "Contextual Enhancement"
      description: "Adding useful context around keywords"
      example:
        awkward: "This 75mm lens has bokeh that is very good."
        natural: "This 75mm lens produces beautifully smooth bokeh that separates subjects from backgrounds effectively."
      implementation: "Add specific details that would help buyers understand the keyword in context"
    
    - name: "Variant Usage"
      description: "Using different forms of the same keyword"
      example:
        repetitive: "The noise cancelling is great. I love the noise cancelling on flights. The noise cancelling works well."
        natural: "The noise cancellation is remarkably effective. I particularly appreciate how it silences engine noise on flights. The cancelling technology works consistently across various environments."
      implementation: "Use different word forms, related terms, and natural variations"
    
    - name: "Experience Integration"
      description: "Embedding keywords within experience narratives"
      example:
        forced: "The forehead thermometer is easy to use."
        natural: "Taking my toddler's temperature with this forehead thermometer was mercifully simple, even with a squirming child."
      implementation: "Weave keywords into specific usage scenarios and authentic experiences"
    
    - name: "Comparative Framing"
      description: "Using keywords within comparative statements"
      example:
        awkward: "Better than Braun thermometers."
        natural: "Unlike my previous Braun thermometer which required perfect positioning, this model provided consistent readings regardless of placement."
      implementation: "Include relevant comparison keywords within specific, detailed contrasts"

    - check: "Keyword Density"
      method: "Ensure primary keywords aren't overused"
      acceptance: "No more than 2-3 usages of the exact same keyword form"
    
    - check: "Natural Language Flow"
      method: "Read sections with keywords aloud to verify they sound natural"
      acceptance: "No awkward phrasing or unnatural constructions"
    
    - check: "Value Context"
      method: "Verify that keywords are surrounded by valuable information"
      acceptance: "Each keyword usage provides helpful context for buyers"
