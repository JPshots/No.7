# Guidelines for creating visually structured reviews that comply with Amazon's formatting restrictions

# =============================================================================
# Core Formatting Principles
# =============================================================================
core_principles:
  description: "Amazon-compliant formatting guidelines that avoid special characters"
  principles:
    - "Use standard keyboard characters to create visual structure"
    - "Avoid special characters that might trigger Amazon's algorithms"
    - "Create consistent visual patterns for improved scannability"
    - "Maintain clear section organization while working within Amazon's limitations"
    - "Focus on content quality rather than elaborate formatting"

# =============================================================================
# Title and Header Formatting
# =============================================================================
title_header_formatting:
  description: "Amazon-compliant formatting for titles and headers"
  
  amazon_title:
    description: "Short, benefit-focused title that appears in Amazon search results"
    guidelines:
      - "Keep under 60 characters"
      - "Focus on primary benefit or outcome"
      - "Include 1-2 primary keywords"
      - "Use action-oriented language when possible"
    examples:
      - "Lens Cap Saved My Workflow!"
      - "Perfect Solution for Identical Lenses!"
      - "Color-Coding Fixed My Lens Confusion!"
  
  review_body_header:
    description: "More creative header for the body of the review"
    guidelines:
      - "Can be longer and more descriptive than Amazon title"
      - "Should expand on the main benefit with more detail"
      - "Uses Amazon-compliant formatting that takes minimal vertical space"
      - "Should complement the review's overall theme"
      - "Split longer titles into title/subtitle format for better mobile display"
    formatting_options:
      - name: "Mobile-Friendly Title Format"
        format: "********** [MAIN TITLE] **********\n[SUBTITLE OR DESCRIPTION]"
        recommended: true
      - name: "Simple Underline"
        format: "[YOUR HEADLINE HERE]\n------------------"
        recommended: true
    examples:
      - "********** Tales from a Kitchen Lab **********\nThe 3oz Glass Measuring Cup Chronicles"
      - "********** Baby Vitamin D Drops **********\nWhen Simple Nutrition Becomes Rocket Science"
  
  section_headers:
    description: "Using ALL CAPS and simple prefixes to enhance section visibility"
    formatting: "ALL CAPS with optional standard character prefix"
    options:
      - ">> THE VERDICT"
      - "** DETAILS & SPECS"
      - "-- PROS"
      - "-- CONS"
      - "*** TIPS & ADVICE"
      - ">> PERFECT FOR"
      - ">> NOT IDEAL FOR"
    implementation: "Place prefix directly before section header text in ALL CAPS"
    examples:
      - ">> THE DAILY EXPERIMENTS"
      - "** THE SPECS"
      - "-- PROS"
      - "-- CONS"
      - "*** FIELD NOTES"

# =============================================================================
# Visual Elements and Dividers
# =============================================================================
visual_elements:
  description: "Amazon-compliant visual elements that enhance review structure"
  
  section_dividers:
    description: "Using standard characters to create horizontal lines separating sections"
    options:
      - "---------------"
      - "==============="
      - "* * * * * * * *"
      - "- - - - - - - -"
      - "_______________"
    implementation: "Place between major sections to create visual breaks, using 15 characters maximum for mobile compatibility"
    usage_guidance:
      - "Use dividers strategically at major transition points, not between every section"
      - "Place dividers after the introduction and before the conclusion"
      - "Keep dividers to 15 characters maximum to prevent wrapping on mobile devices"
  
  attention_markers:
    description: "Using standard characters to highlight key information"
    options:
      - ">> BOTTOM LINE: [concise verdict]"
      - "=> QUICK TAKE: [brief summary]"
      - "** NOTE: [important information]"
    implementation: "Use sparingly for truly important points"
  
  symbol_selection:
    principles:
      - "Limit formatting to standard keyboard characters (*, -, =, >, etc.)"
      - "Maintain consistent symbols throughout the review"
      - "Avoid unusual Unicode characters that might trigger flags"
      - "Use symbols that have clear visual purpose"
    common_symbols:
      section_indicators: ">> ** -- =="
      attention_markers: "=> ** !!"
      decorative_elements: "* - = +"

# =============================================================================
# Paragraph and List Formatting
# =============================================================================
content_formatting:
  description: "Guidelines for formatting paragraphs and lists for maximum readability"
  
  paragraphs:
    guidelines:
      - "Keep paragraphs brief (3-5 sentences) for scannability"
      - "Start with the most important information"
      - "Vary paragraph length throughout the review"
      - "Use single-sentence paragraphs sparingly for emphasis"
      - "Include specific details (measurements, prices) in appropriate paragraphs"
    example: |
      I heard the clink from the next room - that all-too-familiar sound of glass meeting hardwood. Standard glass-breakage scenario initiated: broom deployment, dustpan maneuvers, followed by tactical tweezer operations for rogue foot-shard extraction. Unlike our nearly indestructible glass baby bottles that laugh in the face of gravity, one of our $9 duo chose a more... theatrical exit.
  
  lists:
    guidelines:
      - "Use asterisks (*) for positive points in lists"
      - "Use hyphens (-) for negative points or alternative list items"
      - "Keep list items concise and scannable"
      - "Start list items with strong action verbs or key facts when possible"
      - "Apply the 30-40% personality enhancement rule selectively"
      - "Group related items together for logical flow"
    example: |
      PROS:
      * Perfect size between bulky measuring cups and tiny shot glasses
      * Speaks both metric and imperial (sophisticated!)
      * Pour spout that actually works
      * Ideal for coffee precision and popcorn science

      CONS:
      - Fragile as my ego after someone criticizes my coffee technique
      - Glass thickness suggests it was designed for a gentler universe
      - Advertised as 3oz, but highest marking is 2.5oz (though there's bonus space above)

    The 3oz Glass Measuring Cup Chronicles
    
    I heard the clink from the next room - that all-too-familiar sound of glass meeting hardwood. Standard glass-breakage scenario initiated: broom deployment, dustpan maneuvers, followed by tactical tweezer operations for rogue foot-shard extraction. Unlike our nearly indestructible glass baby bottles that laugh in the face of gravity, one of our $9 duo chose a more... theatrical exit.
    
    ---------------
    >> THE DAILY EXPERIMENTS
    The surviving cup found its calling under my espresso machine. That pour spout? Actually understands fluid dynamics - directing my precious caffeine without the usual counter splatter. But here's the real discovery: fill one past the final 70ml marking (yes, ALL the way up), and you've got the perfect kernel load for a Chinese popcorn cannon. (Yes, that's a real thing, and yes, it's as awesome as it sounds.)
    
    ** THE SPECS
    -- PROS
    * Perfect size between bulky measuring cups and tiny shot glasses
    * Speaks both metric and imperial (sophisticated!)
    * Pour spout that actually works
    * Ideal for coffee precision and popcorn science
    
    -- CONS
    - Fragile as my ego after someone criticizes my coffee technique
    - Glass thickness suggests it was designed for a gentler universe
    - Advertised as 3oz, but highest marking is 2.5oz (though there's bonus space above)
    
    >> THE PRECISION SEEKERS:
    * Coffee enthusiasts needing precise measurements for pour-overs or espresso shots
    * Recipe developers working with small amounts of ingredients
    * Mixologists crafting cocktails requiring exact measurements
    * Detail-oriented cooks who get frustrated with "eyeballing" small quantities
    
    >> NOT FOR THE CAREFREE COOK:
    - Households with young kids (fragile glass)
    - Anyone cooking primarily large-batch recipes where precision is less critical
    
    *** FIELD NOTES
    * Keep the box for storage - these aren't drawer-rummaging tools
    * Perfect for pour-over coffee measurements
    * Use with a scale for ultimate kitchen science
    
    ---------------
    >> RESEARCH CONCLUSIONS
    At $9 for two, they're solid tools for kitchen precision - just maybe keep one in a protective bunker as backup. Perfect for coffee enthusiasts, careful measurers, and anyone who's muttered "but how much is a 'splash' exactly?" while cooking.
