  creative_vision:
    description: "A framework for developing truly original thematic approaches that showcase your unique perspective"
    
    principles:
      - "There are no predefined 'correct' themes - your unique perspective is what makes reviews valuable"
      - "The most memorable reviews often feature unexpected thematic frameworks"
      - "Themes should emerge naturally from your authentic product experience"
      - "Your personal interests, expertise, and background can inspire unique thematic approaches"
      - "The best themes often come from unexpected connections between the product and other domains"
    
    idea_generation:
      cross_domain_mapping:
        description: "Identifying unexpected connections between product and unrelated domains"
        prompts:
          - "If this product were in a completely different industry, what would it be?"
          - "What aspect of nature does this product's function or design remind you of?"
          - "What historical period or movement shares characteristics with this product?"
          - "What movie genre best captures the experience of using this product?"
        example:
          product: "Baby thermometer"
          connection: "Medieval siege warfare - waiting for the perfect moment to capture temperature readings"
          thematic_potential: "Review themed around \"The Art of Temperature Warfare\" with sections like \"BATTLEFIELD PREPARATION\" and \"TACTICAL ADVANTAGES\""
      
      personal_expertise_transfer:
        description: "Applying your unique knowledge domains to product reviews"
        prompts:
          - "How does this product connect to your professional expertise?"
          - "What hobby or personal interest could provide an unexpected lens for this review?"
          - "What specialized vocabulary from your background could create a unique review voice?"
        example:
          product: "Kitchen measuring cups"
          expertise: "Laboratory science background"
          thematic_potential: "Review themed as \"Kitchen Laboratory\" with sections like \"EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\" and \"DATA ANALYSIS\""
  
  theme_discovery:
    description: "A process for identifying and developing product-specific themes rather than forcing pre-determined options"
    principles:
      - "Let themes emerge naturally from product characteristics and testing experiences"
      - "Identify themes during the question-gathering phase rather than after writing begins"
      - "Select themes that naturally complement the product's function, form, or purpose"
      - "Consider multiple potential themes before committing to one"
    process:
      - "During product testing, note any natural metaphors or comparisons that come to mind"
      - "Consider the product's core function and what domains naturally connect to it"
      - "Identify any strong emotional or experiential elements during product use"
      - "Consider 2-3 potential thematic frameworks before selecting the most natural fit"
    generative_questions:
      - "If this product were a character in a story, who would it be and why?"
      - "What process outside the product's domain does the usage experience remind you of?"
      - "What unlikely profession would benefit from the skills needed to use this product well?"
      - "What historical era or movement does this product's design or function evoke?"
      - "What natural process does this product's functionality mimic?"
  
  thematic_options:
    description: "Potential thematic frameworks that can be adapted to various products"
    options:
      - name: "The Quest/Adventure"
        description: "Framing product testing as a journey with challenges and discoveries"
        example: "Our expedition with this kitchen scale began with skepticism but led to unexpected territory."
        product_fit: "Ideal for complex products with learning curves or discovery elements"
      
      - name: "The Relationship Metaphor"
        description: "Positioning the product as having personality and relationship dynamics"
        example: "This thermometer is like that friend who occasionally tells you what you want to hear instead of the truth."
        product_fit: "Perfect for products with consistency issues or trust requirements"
      
      - name: "The Scientific Observation"

        implementation:
          - "Introduce thematic concept in first paragraph"
          - "Use vivid thematic imagery that sets expectations"
          - "Connect theme directly to product purpose"
        example:
          theme: "Kitchen Lab"
          implementation: "Tales from a Kitchen Lab: The 3oz Glass Measuring Cup Chronicles"
      
      - name: "Section Headers"
        purpose: "Reinforce theme through structural elements"
        implementation:
          - "Transform standard headers into theme-aligned versions"
          - "Maintain ALL CAPS for consistency"
          - "Ensure headers still clearly communicate section purpose"
      
      - name: "Strategic Section Points"
        purpose: "Maintain thematic presence throughout content"
        implementation:
          - "Place one thematic reference in each major section"
          - "Use thematic vocabulary consistently across sections"
          - "Position references to enhance rather than interrupt information flow"
        placement:
          - "Position at beginning or end of sections rather than middle"
          - "Use as transition elements between sections when possible"
          - "Place after core information has been delivered"
      
      - name: "Conclusion/Verdict"
        purpose: "Create thematic closure and callback"
        implementation:
          - "Reference opening thematic elements"
          - "Summarize product value in thematic terms"
          - "End with memorable thematic statement"
        example:
          theme: "Kitchen Lab"
          implementation: "Our experiments confirm this measuring cup delivers laboratory-grade precision for your culinary adventures."
  
  thematic_progression_map:
    description: "Guidelines for evolving thematic elements throughout a review rather than maintaining static metaphors"
    principles:
      - "Themes should evolve naturally throughout the review narrative"
      - "Thematic progression creates greater reader engagement than static metaphors"
      - "Different sections benefit from different thematic intensity levels"
    implementation:
      phases:
        - name: "Introduction"
          thematic_intensity: "Medium-High"
          purpose: "Establish thematic concept without overwhelming"
        
        - name: "Technical Sections"
          thematic_intensity: "Low"
          purpose: "Allow technical details to remain clear and accessible"
        
        - name: "Experiential Sections"
          thematic_intensity: "Medium"
          purpose: "Enhance real-world usage with thematic elements"
        
        - name: "Verdict"
          thematic_intensity: "High"
          purpose: "Bring thematic elements to cohesive conclusion"
    example_progression:
      theme: "Dating metaphor for product testing"
      introduction: "Our first date with this spray paint was promising..."
      technical: "Its technical specifications looked good on paper..."
      experiential: "After a few weeks together, we discovered compatibility issues..."
      verdict: "While we're breaking up with this brand, we've started a promising relationship with its competitor..."
  
  balancing_considerations:
    - "Theme integration should enhance rather than obscure information"
    - "Technical sections may have lighter thematic elements"
    - "Narrative sections can support stronger thematic presence"
    - "Headers provide constant thematic framework while content balances theme with information"
    - "Maintain theme throughout but vary intensity based on section purpose"
    - "Allow themes to serve content rather than forcing content to serve themes"
