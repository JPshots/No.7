    description: "Genuine testing and usage provides credibility and insight"
    implementation:
      - "Include specific usage scenarios with contextual details"
      - "Document real-world application beyond theoretical use"
      - "Share unexpected discoveries during testing"
    examples:
      - "After three years of struggling with butterfly popcorn dissolving on contact, these mushroom kernels..."
      - "The silicone grip eliminates that plastic-on-countertop clatter that wakes sleeping babies."

  - driver: "Comprehensive Information"

    implementation:
      - "Cover technical specifications with actual measurements"
      - "Discuss performance across multiple use cases"
      - "Address both expected and unexpected applications"
    examples:
      - "The 70ml capacity and dual measurement systems (oz/ml) make it perfect for precise coffee measurement."
      - "At $8 per bag with an average 15-use lifespan, each popcorn session costs about 53 cents."

  - driver: "Strategic Balance"
    description: "Optimized mix of information and personality creates engaging, helpful content"
    implementation:
      - "Maintain 55% informational, 40% personality, 5% flexibility ratio"

    implementation:
      - "Test product in unconventional scenarios"
      - "Compare with alternatives not mentioned in product description"
      - "Document edge cases and performance limitations"
    examples:
      - "Unlike our nearly indestructible glass baby bottles that laugh in the face of gravity..."
      - "While standard air poppers don't create the same perfect spheres, the cannon method gives you popcorn with architectural integrity."
